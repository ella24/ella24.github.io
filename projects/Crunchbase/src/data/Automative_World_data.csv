We enable those vehicles to understand what people might do next so they can navigate safely and smoothly around humans, including pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers. The level of understanding of our human-like AI goes well beyond what standard physics-based approaches can deliver, including information that can’t be gained any other way.

Importantly, in addition to increased safety, we enable a much more natural and smooth human-like driving of L4/5 autonomous vehicles. This is essential for autonomous vehicles to be accepted into a human-dominated road environment and also by passengers of robotaxi services. Without this capability autonomous vehicles simply will not function well enough.

United States,California,San Jose,XOTAR,"XOTAR is focused on delivering trustworthy AI for autonomous robots. The company is developing a full stack integrated software and hardware platform for Autonomous Robots in the form of a reference architecture consisting of a cloud-based simulator and distributed, embedded sensing and control system (super-controller). The reference architecture approach is designed to coordinate value in the industrial ecosystem (sensor, actuator and vehicle manufacturers). XOTAR has a rigorous and transparent approach to functional specification, training, verification and testing of the cognitive and perceptual functionalities required for safety critical autonomous systems. 

Trustworthy autonomous systems require advanced knowledge of environments in which the robot performs missions (including static and dynamic interactions), in addition to human defined directives for performing. Ultimately the robots need to be trained to perform in a trustworthy manner and learning involves risks that are unacceptable since an element of exploration is required. Simulation is a means to provide the ability to learn optimal and safe behaviors/skills without threatening the environment or people, animals etc. Modelling simulations with the fidelity of real environments is difficult however. XOTAR addresses this by a technology that reconstructs natural environments in a synthetic representation. Our goal is to achieve a synthetic representation of typical environments that the control software cannot distinguish from natural environments. 

This achievement will allow massive simulation and training while also ensuring that the skills acquired will apply to the real world. The promise is safer, higher competence, verified perception, reasoning and motor skills. According to XOTAR's approach, simulation will be used extensively before real-world testing/validation/verification is performed with its associated risks to life.",Domain Specific ProcessingTechnology for Autonomous Robots/Vehicles,"'Autonomous Vehicles', 'Embedded Systems', 'Drones', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Robotics', 'Computer Vision', 'Automotive'","'Transportation', 'Hardware', 'Science and Engineering', 'Software', 'Consumer Electronics', 'Consumer Goods', 'Hardware', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data and Analytics', 'Science and Engineering', 'Software', 'Hardware', 'Science and Engineering', 'Software', 'Hardware', 'Software', 'Transportation'",xotar,2018-05-01,seed,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,a479795ee94e44ceba99c2d2f1fa4e7e,2018,5
