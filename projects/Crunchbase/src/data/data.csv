Bullpen Capital  is an early-stage venture fund being formed to make follow-on investments in Internet technology companies that have been initially funded by super-angel capital efficient funds.  Extending the capital efficient model beyond the seed stage keeps options open for the founders and investors. 

The rise of the super-angels is a capital market response to a new technology trend: the rise of the lean venture, typically an Internet service deploying fast-to-market technology which enables rapid market validation before large capital requirements. The super-angels are emerging as a natural response to a decades long over-sizing of venture firms, built more to fund the semiconductor factories of the past than Internet firms of today.

Bullpen works with its super-angel partners to:
- Extend a seed round to give a start-up more time to prove itself
- Fund a company requiring more early money than the usual seed deal
- Restart a company that is a â€œfallen angelâ€ but still has great promise
- Fund a â€œrising starâ€ needing a small B round it before it goes to VC auction


The lean model does not depend on the lightning strike of finding the rocket-ship that is immediately successful after its seed round.  Almost every rocket-ship has a rocky start, requiring post-seed nurturing before ascending.  This usually entails one or more â€œpivotsâ€, in which a companyâ€:tm:s basic direction must be changed to find its market.  These changes are wrenching, and require additional capital before proof points are met.  Bullpenâ€:tm:s major role is to lead post-seed stage rounds that support these pivots.",Bullpen Capital is an early-stage fund to make follow-on investments for companies who have recently raised seed.,6b6bcb944ce54fd1ad882f9050578381,2018,10

Now it is a question of pressing ahead with digitization even faster and more vigorously. For Axel Springer SE, informative and entertaining journalism is a viable business model also in future on the Internet, along with marketing and classifieds, the other two business segments in which the company is traditionally strong.

In the tradition of its founder, who fostered journalistic and technological innovations in his time, Axel Springer SE is breaking new ground. The company is consistently pursuing the objective of building up a fast-growing and profitable digital portfolio and for this reason is networking today more than ever before with the current generation of founders: digital start-ups.

INVESTMENT PROFILE

In the future, the way we interact with technology will be drastically different, all the screens people currently interact with will disappear and be replaced by more humanistic and natural interfaces.

We think of this as a new era of seamless computing and it is why we are especially interested in funding: Conversational UIs, Robotics, VR/AR, and Software Disrupting Mature Industries. We see artificial intelligence as a layer that will power all these sectors.

Because the partners all have a strong technical background, we look for founders who not only have the vision, but also the chops to build the best products, and the grit required to power through the ups and downs. We generally look for companies we believe can take a monopolistic position in their market. We also have to believe the founder is uniquely positioned to exploit a highly attractive market in terms of competition, size, growth rate and timing.

The Eniac Platform

With Eniac you get four partners for the price of one, and each partner uses their unique experience to open doors and advise our investments. The result has led to companies that consistently bring quality product to market, find follow on investment and have a measurable impact across industries.

With each fund our approach has evolved and expanded to address the growing needs of our portfolio companies. We want our founders to focus on their product so we created the Eniac Platform. Term sheets are just the first step, working with Eniac companies enjoy the following free support:

United States,California,San Francisco,"OneLogin, Inc.","OneLogin is the leader in Unified Access Management, Enabling Organizations to Access the World™. OneLogin makes it simpler and safer for organizations to access the apps and data they need anytime, everywhere. The OneLogin Unified Access Management Platform secures millions of identities for thousands of companies around the globe, spans both cloud and on-prem environments, and unifies all users, devices, and applications to transform enterprises. 

OneLogin's cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution allows enterprises of all sizes to secure their cloud and on-premise apps for all users and devices.

Pre-integrated with thousands of applications, OneLogin enables IT teams to simply and securely tie the company’s directory infrastructure to its business applications. This gives IT centralized access control and the power to enforce rule-based security policies, enable multi-factor authentication, automate user provisioning, and easily report on identity policy compliance.

With OneLogin, enterprises can strengthen security, while eliminating directory integration costs and reduce password trouble ticket load. End users can actively participate in enforcing the identity policy as they benefit from single sign-on access to the thousands of pre-integrated apps for use on their laptops and mobile devices.

OneLogin has millions of users at more than 2000 organizations in more than 44 countries, including AAA, Airbnb, Airbus, Carlyle Group, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Citizen, Fastenal, Herman Miller, Keller Williams, Pandora, San Jose Unified School District, Steelcase, Tableau Software, and Uber.

Solution highlights: * 100% on-demand * Pre-integrated with 4,000+ apps * Integrates with any web app * Market leading directory integration with LDAP, Active Directory, G Suite, Workday, UltiPro, and Namely * Single sign-on and self-service password administration * Automated user on-boarding and instant off-boarding * Role-based access control * Strong authentication with a mobile one-time password app * Two-factor authentication with OneLogin Protect, Duo, RSA, VASCO, SafeNet, Symantec VIP Access, and Yubico Yubikey * Identity compliance reporting * SAML 1.1/2.0, WS-Federation and OpenID single sign-on * Custom connectors for in-house apps * Open-source SAML toolkits.

DIFFERENTIATORS: 

Recent OneLogin differentiating firsts demonstrating the company’s “bridge for authentication across cloud, on-premise, and mobile” include:

OneLogin Adaptive Authentication: OneLogin Adaptive Authentication uses machine learning to build a risk profile that tracks a user’s movement across networks, devices, browsers, and geographies. This information is used to build a user profile for scoring new login attempts and password resets by risk. Some of the factors included in the scoring are IP reputation, device fingerprinting, and geographic location. At the time of authentication, these factors are scored against the user’s profile and the number of required authentication factors are adjusted accordingly. OneLogin’s multi-factor authentication is seamlessly integrated with OneLogin’s single sign-on portal. It also works with numerous other services through the RADIUS and LDAP interfaces of OneLogin’s cloud directory. 

OneLogin Desktop: OneLogin Desktop is endpoint management that enrolls a user's laptop or desktop computer with the OneLogin Cloud Directory, and creates a secure profile on their machine that can only be accessed with the company's OneLogin Cloud Directory credentials. Once the user is in their new secure profile, they can access web- and desktop apps as they please, without entering their credentials again. In other words, once a user logs in to their operating system, they don’t need to login again to access their OneLogin Application Portal and SAML-enabled apps. They only login once.

OneLogin Real-Time Active Directory Sync: OneLogin has the industry’s fastest and most secure Active Directory connector. IT administrators can now automate the process of quickly granting and revoking cloud access to the right users at the right time.

OneLogin Secure RADIUS: OneLogin’s support for RADIUS-enabled appliances, such as Meraki wireless network devices, delivers safe, flexible, and reliable authentication for Wireless and VPN with nothing to install on-premise — an area where other identity management solutions fall short.

OneLogin Virtual LDAP: OneLogin is the only cloud identity management solution that ​supplies ​a virtual LDAP directory service. OneLogin’s Virtual LDAP (VLDAP) service enables organizations to unify multiple corporate directories and protect both on- and off-premise applications and devices.

On-premise Web Access Management (WAM): WAM secures access to your custom and commercial web applications by integrating them into the OneLogin Single Sign-on Portal. This enables you to extend access policies, identity provisioning, and automated off-boarding to on-premises applications just as you do with SaaS applications.  

ACQUISITIONS:

In June 2017, OneLogin acquired Auckland, New Zealand-based ThisData, a developer-focused cloud security company specializing in account takeover detection. The technology has been used to enable OneLogin’s adaptive authentication solution, which uses machine learning to intelligently score the risk of each login attempt, and challenges users making high-risk logins to use an additional authentication factor.

In November 2016, OneLogin acquired Sphere Secure Workspace, Inc., a software vendor with next-generation mobile container technology. The Sphere technology will be used to extend OneLogin’s endpoint security from desktops to mobile devices and thereby providing a unified endpoint management solution for enterprises.

In June 2016, OneLogin acquired Portadi, a cloud-based password management tool. The acquisition enables OneLogin customers to increase employee productivity by automatically populating their OneLogin portal with apps as they manually sign into them.

In December 2015 OneLogin acquired Cafésoft, a provider of on-premise Web Access Management (WAM) software, which allows OneLogin to provide a more comprehensive identity solution for hybrid environments.

In 2015, Josh (CEO) and Kevin (CTO) were working together at Habitat when the frequent game of “where’s the latest design” finally drove Kevin to ask, “Why don’t designers have proper version control?”

Designers have always been a flexible bunch. Dedicated to bring great ideas to life and willing to use every possible tool and jump through all kinds of hoops to get their work done. Unfortunately, too much of the design toolset is focused on creating isolated artifacts instead of supporting connected workflows. Designers need more support for the half of their job that isn’t drawing shapes, choosing typefaces, or prototyping interactions. The majority of a design job is orchestrating the team, ensuring visual consistency, updating stakeholders, documenting decisions, interpreting feedback, and delivering the work for implementation. When you look at it this way, it becomes clear. We don’t need more visual design tools. We need help managing our work and how design relates to the rest of the organization.

United States,California,San Francisco,IronChain Capital,"In 2012, Jonathan Benassaya discovered Bitcoin and blockchain technology through Wences Casares, famed entrepreneur and cryptocurrency advocate. While the notion of cryptocurrency may have seemed outlandish at the time, the technological innovation and potential impact of the blockchain - a worldwide, secure, and distributed system - was nothing short of revolutionary.

For the first time in history, a transactional architecture without any physical boundaries or limitations, completely free from governmental oversight or intermediation, was created. In contrast to the birth of Internet, billions of computers and a large communication network already existed, thereby providing the infrastructure for blockchain technology and its native currencies to flourish and thrive. Fast forward to 2017, the digital asset market is experiencing unprecedented and meteoric growth, with application development for the blockchain also occurring at a record pace. The comparisons to the early days of the Internet are not only inevitable, but eerily similar. Reminiscent of the late 1990s, they are embarking on a new world order that is destined to forever change how they view financial services, technology, and governmental involvement. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology hold the promise of revolutionizing the global monetary system, just as the Internet permanently altered how they communicate and access information. For the greater population, however this new revolution is challenging to not only understand, but also to participate in. Enter IronChain Capital, a new company focused on a singular and all-important mission: to provide all investors with easy and secure access to the cryptocurrency asset class, on a highly cost-effective and diversified basis.","IronChain Capital, a San Francisco, CA-based digital asset investment firm.","'Asset Management', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Financial Services'","'Financial Services', 'Financial Services', 'Payments', 'Software', 'Financial Services'",ironchain-capital,2018-05-14,venture,0,2500000.0,3.0,Matrix Partners,Organization,venture_capital,"Matrix Partners works with visionary founders of early-stage startups to amplify their potential.
